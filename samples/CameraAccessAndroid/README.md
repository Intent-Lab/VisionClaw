# Camera Access App

A sample Android application demonstrating integration with Meta Wearables Device Access Toolkit. This app showcases streaming video from Meta AI glasses, capturing photos, and managing connection states.

## Features

- Connect to Meta AI glasses
- Stream camera feed from the device
- Capture photos from glasses
- Share captured photos

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox (2021.3.1) or newer
- JDK 11 or newer
- Android SDK 31+ (Android 12.0+)
- Meta Wearables Device Access Toolkit (included as a dependency)
- A Meta AI glasses device for testing (optional for development)

## Building the app

### Using Android Studio

1. Clone this repository
1. Open the project in Android Studio
1. Add your personal access token (classic) to the `local.properties` file (see [SDK for Android setup](https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/getting-started-toolkit/#sdk-for-android-setup))
1. Click **File** > **Sync Project with Gradle Files**
1. Click **Run** > **Run...** > **app**

### Signing keys

This sample no longer ships a checked-in `app/sample.keystore`. AGP
auto-generates a per-developer debug keystore at
`~/.android/debug.keystore` on first build, which is what `assembleDebug`
and (for sample evaluation) `assembleRelease` will use. **Do not commit
keystores or `.jks` files** — they are signing keys and have been added
to `.gitignore`. To distribute real release builds, replace the release
`signingConfig` in `app/build.gradle.kts` with credentials sourced from
your CI's secret store.

## Running the app

1. Turn 'Developer Mode' on in the Meta AI app.
1. Launch the app.
1. Press the "Connect" button to complete app registration.
1. Once connected, the camera stream from the device will be displayed
1. Use the on-screen controls to:
   - Capture photos
   - View and save captured photos
   - Disconnect from the device
